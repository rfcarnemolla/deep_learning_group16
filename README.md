# deep_learning_group16

Exploration and testing was performed in different files, but phil_model.py is the final
model used and most represented by our presented model architecture. Running it will output
the predictions of the model. Several libraries must be installed to do so, and they are
listed in the include statements at the top. The dataset is included,but to re-generate it,
the data.ipynb can be run.
